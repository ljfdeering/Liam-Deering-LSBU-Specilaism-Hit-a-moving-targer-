Hit a moving target 


Before starting I will go over some brief functionality of the package before explaining what set up is needed for putting this into a new scene. 

This package will work by getting the player location once in range of the object firing in this a turret and it will turn so a select part will be facing the player before firing it has a configurable range fire rate and how fast the turret can turn all within in the inspector 

To have this work within your scene simply add or set the tag to the object you wish the target to hit, the default one is player which is a default tag within unity.
